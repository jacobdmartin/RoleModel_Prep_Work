        <li><u>Washington DC</u><br />
          <em><strong>Description: </strong></em><br />
          Washington was named after the first U.S. President George Washington. The "D.C." stands for "District of Columbia," a special area created that is not a state called a federal district. At first, it was made up of a piece from Virginia south of the Potomac River and a piece from Maryland north of the Potomac River.

        <li><u>Topsail Island</u><br />
          <em><strong>Description: </strong></em><br />
          Although folklore has it that the island was named Topsail (pronounced Tops'l) because pirate ships hid behind the island with their topsails visible from the sea, the name came from New Topsail Inlet. This inlet's name can be found on early navigational charts with the other Topsail Inlet located in Beaufort, N.C.
        </li>
        <li><u>New Zealand</u><br />
          <em><strong>Description: </strong></em><br />
          New Zealand, Maori Aotearoa, island country in the South Pacific Ocean, the southwesternmost part of Polynesia. New Zealand is a remote land—one of the last sizable territories suitable for habitation to be populated and settled—and lies more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Australia, its nearest neighbour.
